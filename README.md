# use-yarn
> Force users to use `yarn` instead of `npm`.

If running `npm install` instead of `yarn`, the process will exit with error code `1`
and print an [error message](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AndersDJohnson/use-yarn/master/message.txt).
Will not block on install of specific packages like `npm install my-package`.
